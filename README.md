 Just a calendar

Here i'm trying to create a calendar for my private teaching job (yes i'm poor), with the help of Google Calendar for the events data, Google Spreadsheets, and AppsScript for making them communicate and develop a possibly intuitive visual summary.

I'm extremely new so every advice is appreciated, thanks for reading!
