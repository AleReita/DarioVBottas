Presenting: Just a Calendar!

Here I’m attempting to create a calendar to tackle the challenge of organizing my private teaching job (yes, I’m poor). I’ll be using Google Calendar for event data, Google Spreadsheets for organizing, and Apps Script to make everything talk to each other and hopefully come up with a nice, intuitive visual summary.

I’m super new to all of this, so any advice or tips are greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading!
